// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1.Ask for and declare Num1
2.Ask for and declare Num2
2.Set sum = Num1 + Num2
3. Out put the value of sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1.Ask for number and declare Num1
2.IF Num1 divided by 2 has remainder 
	THEN output "Number is Odd"
		ELSE output "Number is Even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)Ask for and set Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4, Num5
b)Set AVG of to sum of Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4, Num5 to avg and output 
c)For largest use for loop for all data Num1-Num5
	IF Num1 > Num2
		then set Num1 equal to max
		else set Num2 equal to max
	output max
For smallest use for loop for all data Num1-Num5
	IF Num1 < Num2
		then set Num1 equal to min
		else set Num2 equal to min
	output min

d)output avg max and min
